  "desc": "I learned HTML5 and CSS3 web languages at the age of 14, and then developed my skills in Javascript (then Typescript), which I've been using professionally for 10 years. In particular, I have a very good command of the Angular ecosystem, which I've been using in-house for 7 years, with RxJs and NGXS for example. I've also used the React framework and Next.js for my personal projects."
